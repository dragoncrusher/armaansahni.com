    <h1>How I coded a game using AI as a 9 year old.</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Armaan and I'm 9 years old.</p>
    <p>
      Today I want to show you how I wrote a game in JavaScript using AI
      <a href="game/">The game link</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't just get AI to write a game for me. I used it to help find out about new codes like .Append child and
      setTimeout()
    </p>
    <h2>why I chose JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      I first started coding with the Godot game engine. But that was too complicated and used the language called
      GDscript that I did not know. So my Dad decided to teach me how to code my own game using HTML And CSS, which were
      the two languages that I knew. He did this by giving me coding tests. Which were where he told me to make
      something and I had to make it using code, and I was able to research using AI and Google search. He also did not
      tell me in whitch language I could do these tests So I would figure it out on my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I only knew three languages, HTML CSS and he little bit of JavaScript. So I chose to use JavaScript because the
      easiest way to do the things that my dad was giving me was functions, and there was no way to create functions in
      HTML and CSS, in JavaScript, though, there was.
    </p>
    <h2>I learned how to use AI to help me</h2>
    <p>
      Out of my two options for research, AI and Google search. I used AI because you can talk to AI like a person which
      to me was easier than looking at pre-written blogs on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I asked AI about code it would give me an explanation, then I would give it my understanding and ask it if I
      was understanding right and if I wasn't it would give me another explanation.
    </p>
    <p>Also, AI had the microphone tool which I could use to speak which was faster than typing.</p>
    <h2>I built the game in baby steps</h2>
    <p>
      My idea for the game was: that there would be some buttons to chose a enemy hp level then you ansered a math
      question and if you got it, right you would do 10 damage to the HP level you chose but if you got it wrong, you
      would take one damage and the goal was to bring the HP level you have to 0 before your HP level goes to 0.
    </p>
    <h3>Game progress step #1</h3>
    <p>
      there were 6 buttons, you selected one and it would set the enemy HP level then you clicked the attack button. And
      it asked you a math question randomize from an array of eight math questions. And if you got it right you would do
      the enemy HP 10 HP, but if you got it wrong, then your HP level that you had would go down by 10. and if you your
      HP level went to 0 then you lost but if the enemy HP level went to 0 you won.

    <h3>Game progress step #2</h3>
    <p>
      there were 2 img tags which each had an image in it. One had a wizard, this was your character. He didn't do
      anything. It was just to represent your character. The next one was a boss. This image would very depending on
      which button you clicked. Each different image\boss had a different enemy HP level.

    <h3>Game progress step #3</h3>
    <p>
      there were animations in the characters, when you got the question right the wizard would raise his wizards staff
      and then bring it down. And then the boss image would have its background turn red and then back to white. But
      when you got the question wrong the boss would do something . And then the wizard image would have its background
      turn red and then back to white. For my pictures I used the Piskel app. The Piskel app had Layers and Frames,
      which were what I used for animation.Layer`s are like one transparent slab in a stack of transparent slabs you
      write stuff on each one and they appear in front and behind of each other so all the layers are visible in the
      same time. For example, you would put a background as your last layer and the main front. Of the image as your
      first layer and everything else in between.Frames are like a small time periods. Each frame has the same amount of
      layers. Each frame can represent as many seconds as you want. The frame will last for that amount of time and then
      switch to the next frame. For example if I was going to make an animation of a tree falling over, the first frame
      would be the tree standing straight. the last frame would be the tree completely sideways on the ground.

      I collected a lot of feedback and refined my game.To refine something means to make it better by adding a few
      changes.By now because I had turns, your turn and the boss's turn. I made the characters whose turn it was outline
      Circle glow blue.I also made the background adjust size if it was a phone so my game could be played on the phone.
