Dangers of using AI at school


Hello my name is Armaan and I am 10 years old. I am here to tell you about using AI in school. 
 
When it comes to schoolwork, AI can be very helpful. For schoolwork, AI can provide you with correct answers in subjects like math, which it is very good at.

But when AI gives you the answer, it is not your work! This defeats the purpose of going to school because you are not learning. Instead, you are just asking AI a question, and then copy-pasting the answer. When you do this you will become dependent on the AI and not know how to think!!!!!

Additionally, AI is not always right! Sometimes AI “hallucinates” and gives the wrong answer. This is because AI just predicts the next most common word. Every time AI makes a mistake, you will not catch the mistake, and you will get the question wrong.


Once you have a job, you will still be dependent on AI. This means that when AI hallucinates, you will not catch it. Then you will take the wrong information AI gave you and do your job assignments wrong. Also, if you do not have AI, you will not know what to do.

If you use AI in school, you will not learn. If you do not learn, you will not have the skills for later in life!
